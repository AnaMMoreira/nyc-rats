## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In a Gothamist news article, [Rodents on the rise: How NYC is losing the rat battle](https://gothamist.com/news/rodents-on-the-rise-how-nyc-is-losing-the-rat-battle?fbclid=IwAR0pbcNAk-yfgqFUHerhvtJKHcjrvVLESGORmzxSIhFQwtooGSHg9uG7dXU), Jake Offenhartz asserts that complaints of rat sightings in 2021 increased by more than two-thirds compared to the same period in 2019. Offenhartz suggests that a citywide temporary halt of pest control inspections at the start of the pandemic may be a significant factor of this increase in reported rat sightings more than two years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The COVID-19 pandemic also coincided with a racial reckoning which left many wondering how the City would grapple with structural racism. As New York City tackles its rat problems, what role do the socioeconomic factors the of its residents play? The Gothamist article goes on to quoute Sandy Nurse, the chair of the City Council’s Sanitation Committee, who called for “a more aggressive rat mitigation strategy, particularly in areas with high complaints, like public housing areas.” 

Is Nurse's claim that areas with high complaints are coming from areas like public housing or are wealthier zip codes more likely to file a complaint? To improve the city’s rat mitigation efforts in an equitable way, we must first understand the relationship between reported rat sightings and socioeconomic factors.  

### Questions Project Hopes to Answer 
* Is there a socioeconomic relationship between rat sightings and boroughs? zip codes? 
* Is there a socioeconomic relationship between rat sightings and neighborhood income? cost of rent? (OTHER FACTORS EVALUATED)
